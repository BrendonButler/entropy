# Contributing to Entropy

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Entropy. It's people like you that make Entropy such a great tool.

## Where to start?

Issues that are not assigned to anyone are a good place to start. Look for the labels `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you are new to the project.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the Entropy. Please search the existing issues for your bug and create a new one if the issue is not yet tracked!

Here's a link to the issue tracker: [Issues](https://github.com/BrendonButler/entropy/issues)

## Feature Requests

We would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this project and further the aims of our project. Please fill out a feature request ticket in the issue tracker if it doesn't already exist and provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Commits

Commits that are tied to an issue should include the issue number in the commit message. For example, `GH-1234` would be a commit message that is tied to issue 1234. They should also be committed to a feature branch with the issue tag `feature/GH-1234` or `feature/GH-1234-concise-description`. Additional lines may be used for the commits, but the first line should be concise and descriptive of the change.
